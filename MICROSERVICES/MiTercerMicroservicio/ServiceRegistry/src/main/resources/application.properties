# Sets the HTTP port where the application will run.
# Port 8761 is traditionally used for Eureka servers.

# Tells the app not to register itself with Eureka.
# This is typical for a Eureka server, which doesn?t need to advertise itself as a client.

# Sets the base URL used by Spring Boot Admin Client to send monitoring data (like health, metrics, etc.).
# In this case, it points to the same host and port (localhost:8761), suggesting that Spring Boot Admin

# Exposes all Actuator monitoring endpoints (e.g., /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics, etc.).
# This is useful for Spring Boot Admin or other monitoring tools that need access to all endpoints.

# Configures the /actuator/health endpoint to always show detailed health information (e.g., DB status, disk, etc.).
